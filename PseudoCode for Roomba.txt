Byte starts in watch floor.
Using tophat sensor it will follow the internal network connection to collect files.
Knocking down the Patch Holder in the process.
Using a color sensor we will categorize files into two groups.(Corrupt and Benign)
Using an arm mechanism when the robot is 20 inches away from the arm it will start raising the arm and flicking the switch.
Using the bumper sensor that is built in byte will know when it hits the end.
It will then turn 180 degrees and drive forward 36 inches, aka the location of the backup room, and will deposit the corrupt files.
Finally it will turn 90 degrees and drive forward 6 inches, aka the location of the Analysis Lab and deposit the Benign files.
